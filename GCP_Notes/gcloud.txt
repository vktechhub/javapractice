gcloud is the command-line tool for interacting with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It allows you to manage your GCP resources and services from the terminal. Here are some common gcloud commands:
*. To initialize gcloud and set up your environment:
   ```
   gcloud init
   ```  THis is the first command you should run after installing gcloud. It will guide you through the process of setting up your account, selecting a default project, and configuring other settings.
*. To authenticate with your Google account:
   ```   gcloud auth login
   ```
    You can list the active account name with this command:
    ```   gcloud auth list
*. To list all available gcloud commands:
    ```   gcloud help
    ```   gcloud -h
*. To create a new project:
    ```   gcloud projects create [PROJECT_ID]
    ```
*. Config
    The results of the gcloud config --help and gcloud help config commands are the same. They show you how to manage your gcloud configuration settings, such as setting the active project, region, and zone. Here are some common gcloud config commands:
    To view the list of configurations in your environment:
    ```   gcloud config list    
    To see all properties and their settings:
    ```   gcloud config list --all
    To set the active project:
    ```   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
    To set the region to <REGION>
    ```   gcloud config set compute/region REGION
    Set the zone to <ZONE>:
    ```   gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
    To view the project region setting, run the following command:
    ```   gcloud config get-value compute/region
    To view the project zone setting, run the following command:
    ```   gcloud config get-value compute/zone
    To view the project id for your project:
    ```   gcloud config get-value project

    You can list the project ID with this command:
    ```   gcloud config list project
    to view details about the project:
    ```   gcloud compute project-info describe --project $(gcloud config get-value project)

    List your components:
    ```   gcloud components list

    Set Environment Variables for Project ID:
        Create an environment variable to store your Project ID:
        ```   export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
        Create an environment variable to store your Zone:
        ```   export ZONE=$(gcloud config get-value compute/zone)
        To verify that your variables were set properly, run the following commands:
        ```   echo -e "PROJECT ID: $PROJECT_ID\nZONE: $ZONE"
   To list all projects:
    ```   gcloud projects list
    ```
*.  Compute Engine Instances
    To create a new Compute Engine instance:
    ```   gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone=[ZONE] --machine-type=[MACHINE_TYPE] --image-family=[IMAGE_FAMILY] --image-project=[IMAGE_PROJECT]
    ```
    To open help for the create command, run the following command:
    ```   gcloud compute instances create --help
     To list all Compute Engine instances:
    ```   gcloud compute instances list
    ```
    --filter to list specific instances:
    ```   gcloud compute instances list --filter="name=[INSTANCE_NAME]"
    ```
    To delete a Compute Engine instance:
    ```   gcloud compute instances delete [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone=[ZONE]
    ```
    To connect to your VM with SSH, run the following command:
    ```   gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone $ZONE
    Add a tag to the virtual machine:
    ```   gcloud compute instances add-tags [INSTANCE_NAME] --tags [TAG_NAME] 
*. List the firewall rules in the project:
    ```   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   List the firewall rules for the default network:
    ```   gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="network='default'"
   List the firewall rules for the default network where the allow rule matches an ICMP rule:
    ```   gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="NETWORK:'default' AND ALLOW:'icmp'"
    Update the firewall rule to allow:
    ```   gcloud compute firewall-rules create [default-allow-http] --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=http-server
            Here is a breakdown of the syntax and the purpose of each flag:
                    Syntax Element 	                        Description
                    gcloud compute firewall-rules create	The base command to create a new firewall rule resource [2].
                    [default-allow-http]	                The name you are assigning to this specific firewall rule. This name must be unique within your project [2].
                    --direction=INGRESS	                    Specifies that the rule applies to incoming traffic to your instances [2]. (The alternative is EGRESS, for outgoing traffic).
                    --priority=1000	                        Determines the order in which firewall rules are evaluated. Lower numbers have higher priority and are checked first [2].
                    --network=default	                    pecifies the VPC network the rule applies to. default is the name of the network created automatically for new projects [2].
                    --action=ALLOW	                        Specifies the action to take when the traffic matches the rule's criteria (in this case, ALLOW the traffic) [2].
                    --rules=tcp:80	                        The protocol and port to which the rule applies. This allows incoming traffic only on TCP port 80 (standard HTTP) [2].
                    --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0	            Defines the source IP addresses the rule applies to. 0.0.0.0/0 is CIDR notation for "any IP address from anywhere on the internet" [2].
                    --target-tags=http-server	            The rule applies only to VM instances that have the network tag http-server. Instances without this tag are not affected by this rule [2].

    Verify communication is possible for http to the virtual machine:
    ```   curl http://$(gcloud compute instances list --filter=name:gcelab2 --format='value(EXTERNAL_IP)')

*. To deploy an application to App Engine:
    ```   gcloud app deploy
    ```
    To list all App Engine services:
    ```   gcloud app services list
    ```
    To view logs for a specific service:
    ```   gcloud app logs read [SERVICE_NAME]
    ```
*. To create a new Cloud Storage bucket:
    ```   gcloud storage buckets create [BUCKET_NAME]
    ```   gcloud storage buckets create gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   To list all Cloud Storage buckets:
    ```   gcloud storage buckets list
    ```        
*. To install
    To install a specific component, run the following command:
    ```   gcloud components install [COMPONENT_NAME]
    ```
    Run the following command to install NGINX:
    ```   sudo apt-get install -y nginx
    Run the following command to confirm that NGINX is running:
    ```   ps auwx | grep nginx
*. Viewing the system logs
    View the available logs on the system:
    ```   gcloud logging logs list
    View the logs that relate to compute resources:
    ```   gcloud logging logs list --filter="compute"
    Read the logs related to the resource type of gce_instance:
    ```   gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance" --limit 5
    Read the logs for a specific virtual machine:
    ```   gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance AND labels.instance_name='gcelab2'" --limit 5
