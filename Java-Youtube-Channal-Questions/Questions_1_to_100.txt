1. What is Java?
        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
        Java supports OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
        (doesn't support multiple inheritance through classes but supports it through interfaces)
        Functional programming features like lambda expressions and streams were introduced in Java 8.
        It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), web applications, and more. 
        Java is known for its portability across platforms, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which allows Java programs to run on any device that has the JVM installed.
        Statically typed, compiled language with automatic memory management (garbage collection).

JVM and JRE:
        JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. 
        It provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. The JVM is platform-dependent, meaning there are different implementations for different operating systems.
        JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a package that provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java. 
        It does not include development tools like compilers or debuggers, which are part of the JDK (Java Development Kit).

        does jvm part of jre?
        Yes, the JVM is a part of the JRE. The JRE includes the JVM along with the standard libraries and other components necessary to run Java applications.

2. Object class in Java - Super class of all classes
        The Object class is the root class of the Java class hierarchy. Every class in Java implicitly extends the Object class if it does not explicitly extend another class. 
        This means that all classes in Java inherit the methods defined in the Object class.

3. Key methods provided by the Object class include:
        - toString(): Returns a string representation of the object.
        - equals(Object obj): Compares this object to the specified object for equality.
        - hashCode(): Returns a hash code value for the object.
        - getClass(): Returns the runtime class of the object.
        - wait(), notify(), notifyAll(): Methods used for thread synchronization.
    Stay away from:
        - clone(): Creates and returns a copy of this object (if the class implements Cloneable).
        - finalize(): Called by the garbage collector before an object is removed from memory.

4. String Vs char[]
        String is immutable whereas char[] is mutable.
        String literals are stored in the String pool (a special memory area in the heap) for memory efficiency, while char[] are stored in the regular heap memory.
        Strings have many built-in methods for manipulation (like substring, concat, etc.), while char[] requires manual handling for such operations.
        Strings are generally easier to use and more convenient for text manipulation, while char[] can be more efficient for certain operations that require frequent modifications.
        Strings can be compared using equals() method for content comparison, while char[] can be compared using Arrays.equals() method.
        String is a class in Java, while char[] is an array of primitive data type char.
        String to char[] conversion can be done using toCharArray() method method, while char[] to String conversion can be done using the String constructor or toString() method.
