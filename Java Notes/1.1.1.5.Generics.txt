Generics are not a separate data type category â€”
they are a feature of reference types (specifically, of classes, interfaces, and methods).

âœ… Generics are type parameters, not data types themselves.

They let you create classes, interfaces, and methods that work with different data types safely (type-safe, compile-time checking).



ðŸ§± Generics Can Be Used In
Where	            Example	                            Explanation
Generic Class	    class Box<T> { T value; }	        T is a type parameter
Generic Interface	interface Comparable<T>	            Used in sorting, etc.
Generic Method	<T> void print(T item)	                Works for any type
Generic Collection	List<String>, Map<Integer, String>	Part of Java Collections Framework
