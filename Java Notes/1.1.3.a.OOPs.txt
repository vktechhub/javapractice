OOPS in Java
OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System. 
It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. 
Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it follows the principles of OOPS.

The main principles of OOPS are:    
1. Encapsulation: 
    This principle states that the data (attributes) and the code (methods) that manipulates the data should be bundled together in a single unit called a class. 
    This helps in protecting the data from unauthorized access and modification.
2. Inheritance: 
    This principle allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). 
    This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
3. Polymorphism: 
    This principle allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single method to perform different tasks based on the object that it is acting upon. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
4. Abstraction: 
    This principle focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity and increases efficiency by allowing the user to interact with the object at a higher level.

In Java, these principles are implemented through classes and objects. 
    A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. 
    Java provides various features such as access modifiers, interfaces, and abstract classes to support OOPS concepts effectively.
    
Overall, OOPS in Java helps in creating modular, maintainable, and scalable software applications by promoting code organization and reusability.

OOPS Concepts in Java
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. 
Java is an object-oriented programming language that follows the OOP principles. 
The main concepts of OOP in Java are:
1. Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of the objects.
2. Objects: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains data and methods to manipulate that data.
3. Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from that class.
4. Constructors: A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's properties.
5. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass).
6. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
7. Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
8. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together in a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.
9. Interfaces: An interface is a reference type in Java that defines a contract for classes to implement. It contains abstract methods that must be implemented by the classes that implement the interface.
10. Packages: A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It helps in avoiding name conflicts and controlling access.
11. Getters and Setters: Getters and setters are methods used to access and update the private attributes of a class.
12. this keyword: The "this" keyword is used to refer to the current object instance within a class. It is commonly used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters or other variables with the same name.
13. Super keyword: The "super" keyword is used to refer to the superclass (parent class) of the current object. It is commonly used to call superclass methods and constructors.
14. Static keyword: The "static" keyword is used to define class-level variables and methods that belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class/Object.
15. Final keyword: The "final" keyword is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes.
16. Abstract keyword: The "abstract" keyword is used to declare abstract classes and abstract methods. An abstract class cannot be instantiated, and an abstract method must be implemented by subclasses.
17. Instanceof keyword: The "instanceof" keyword is used to test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements a specific interface.
18. Access Modifiers: Access modifiers are keywords used to define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. The main access modifiers in Java are public, private, protected, and default (no modifier).
