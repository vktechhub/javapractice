Frequently used SpringBootAnnotations which is not in Spring Framework:- 
1. @SpringBootApplication
    * It is a convenience annotation that combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
    * It indicates that the class is the main entry point for a Spring Boot application.

        1a. @EnableAutoConfiguration
            * It tells Spring Boot to automatically configure your application based on the dependencies present on the classpath.
            * It eliminates the need for manual configuration.

        1b. @ComponentScan
            * It tells Spring to scan the specified package and its sub-packages for Spring components 
            (e.g., @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller) to register them as beans in the application context.

        1c. @Configuration
            * It indicates that the class contains bean definitions and configuration settings for the application.



6. @ConfigurationProperties 
    * It is used to bind external configuration properties (from application.properties or application.yml) to a Java class.
    * It allows for type-safe configuration and easier management of application settings.

7. @SpringBootTest
    * It is used for integration testing in Spring Boot applications.
    * It loads the full application context and allows you to write tests that interact with the entire application.

These annotations help simplify the development of Spring Boot applications by providing convenient ways to configure and manage various aspects of the application.
