Stack Vs Heap Memory
------------------------------
In Java, the run time memory of JVM (in RAM) is primarily divided into two areas: Stack and Heap.
Stack Memory
        ✔ Stack memory is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread.
        ✔ It stores primitive data types (int, char, boolean, etc.) and references to objects in heap memory.
        ✔ Stack memory follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
        ✔ Each thread has its own stack memory.
        ✔ Stack memory is faster to access compared to heap memory.
Heap Memory
        ✔ Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation for Java objects and JRE classes at runtime
        ✔ It stores all the objects created using the new keyword.
        ✔ Heap memory is shared among all threads.
        ✔ It is managed by the Garbage Collector, which automatically frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced.
        ✔ Heap memory is generally larger than stack memory but slower to access.

Stack vs Heap Comparison
------------------------------
        Aspect               | Stack Memory                     | Heap Memory
        ---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------
        Purpose              | Static memory allocation         | Dynamic memory allocation
        Storage              | Primitive data types, references | Java objects
        Access Speed         | Faster                           | Slower
        Memory Management    | Managed by thread                | Managed by Garbage Collector
        Size                 | Smaller                          | Larger
        Lifetime             | Short-lived (method scope)       | Long-lived (object lifetime)

Heap and Stack 
------------------------------
When a Java program is executed, the JVM allocates memory for variables and objects in both stack and heap memory.

1. Stack Memory Allocation:
   - When a method is called, a new block is created in the stack memory to hold the method's local variables and references.
   - Primitive data types are stored directly in the stack.
   - References to objects created in heap memory are stored in the stack.

2. Heap Memory Allocation:
   - When an object is created using the new keyword, memory for that object is allocated in the heap.
   - The reference to that object is returned and stored in the stack memory.
