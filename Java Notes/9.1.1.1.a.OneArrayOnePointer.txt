One Array - One pointer Algorithm - Also called Single Pointer Technique

This is a single-pointer technique where: 
        i. You have one input array or string
                - Array can be sorted or unsorted
        ii. You use one pointer to traverse the array or string from start to end linearly
                - Pointer can move one step at a time
                - Pointer can be incremented or decremented based on the logic
 
When to use: 
    * This technique is useful for problems that require processing elements in a linear fashion, such as searching, filtering, or transforming data. 

Sample problems:- 
    * Find or Calculate the maximum or minimum or average or sum of elements in an array
    * Reverse an array or string
    * Count occurrences of a specific element in an array
    * Check if an array is sorted or not
    * Find the first occurrence of a target value in an array

    To try:- 
    * Sorting an array using selection sort or bubble sort
    * Move all zeros to the start or end of an array
    * Remove duplicates from a sorted array
    * Count the frequency of elements in an array
    * Find the index of the first non-repeating element in an array

How to apply in Java: 
    1. Initialize a pointer variable to the starting index of the array (usually 0).
    2. Use a loop (for or while) to iterate through the array until the pointer reaches the end of the array.
    3. Inside the loop, access the current element using the pointer and perform the required operations.
    4. Increment or decrement the pointer based on the logic of your algorithm.
    5. Continue this process until all elements have been processed.

Template:-
public int fn(int[] arr) { 
    int ans = 0; 
 
    for (int pointer = 0; pointer < arr.length; pointer++) { 
        if (CONDITION) { 
            // arr[pointer] contributes to the calculation of ans
        } 
    }
    return ans;
}

    // or use while loop
public int fn(int[] arr) {
    int pointer = 0; 
    while (pointer < arr.length) { 
        if (CONDITION) { 
            // arr[pointer] contributes to the calculation of ans
        } 
        pointer++; 
    } 
    return ans; 
} 

Example 1: Find the maximum element in an array
public int findMax(int[] arr) { 
    int pointer = 0; 
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    // Loop through the array using single pointer
    while (pointer < arr.length) { 
        if (arr[pointer] > max) { 
            max = arr[pointer]; 
        } 
        pointer++; 
    }
    return max;
}
