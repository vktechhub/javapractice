SpringBoot Actuators:
    Spring Boot Actuator is a powerful feature that provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application. 
    It exposes various endpoints that give insights into the application's health, metrics, environment, and more.

How to enable Actuator:
    To enable Actuator in your Spring Boot application, you need to add the following dependency to your build file:

    For Maven:
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    For Gradle:
    ```groovy
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
    ```

Available endpoints:
    Once Actuator is enabled, you can access various endpoints by default. 
    These endpoints are accessible via HTTP and provide valuable information about your application.

    * /actuator/ - Lists all available Actuator endpoints.
    * /actuator/health - Provides information about the health of the application.
    * /actuator/health/{component} - Provides health information for a specific component.
    * /actuator/health/components - Provides health information for all components.
    * /actuator/health/liveness - Indicates if the application is alive.
    * /actuator/health/readiness - Indicates if the application is ready to serve requests.
    * /actuator/healthchecks - Displays results of health checks.
    * /actuator/metrics - Exposes various metrics about the application.
    * /actuator/metrics/system - Exposes system-level metrics.
    * /actuator/metrics/{metricName} - Provides detailed information about a specific metric.
    * /actuator/metrics/custom - Provides custom metrics defined by the user.
    * /actuator/env - Displays environment properties.
    * /actuator/threaddump - Provides a thread dump of the application.
    * /actuator/loggers - Allows you to view and modify the logging levels.
    * /actuator/audit - Provides audit logs for security-related events.    
    * /actuator/auditevents - Displays audit events.
    * /actuator/info - Displays arbitrary application information.
    * /actuator/beans - Lists all Spring beans in the application context.
    * /actuator/mappings - Shows all request mappings in the application.
    * /actuator/conditions - Displays auto-configuration conditions.
    * /actuator/configprops - Shows configuration properties.
    * /actuator/httptrace - Provides HTTP trace information.
    * /actuator/scheduledtasks - Displays scheduled tasks.
    * /actuator/caches - Shows cache information.
    * /actuator/sessions - Manages HTTP sessions.
    * /actuator/prometheus - Exposes metrics in a format suitable for Prometheus.
    * /actuator/heapdump - Provides a heap dump of the application.
    * /actuator/logfile - Displays the contents of the application log file.
    * /actuator/shutdown - Allows for graceful shutdown of the application (disabled by default).
    * /actuator/featureflags - Displays feature flags status.
    * /actuator/trace - Provides trace information for requests.
    * /actuator/custom-endpoint - Example of a custom endpoint you can create.
    * /actuator/maintenance - Displays maintenance mode status.
    * /actuator/uptime - Shows the application's uptime.
    * /actuator/dependencies - Lists application dependencies.
    * /actuator/version - Displays the application version.
    * /actuator/alerts - Shows active alerts for the application.
    * /actuator/notifications - Manages application notifications.
    * /actuator/jobs - Displays information about background jobs.
    * /actuator/tasks - Lists all tasks scheduled in the application.
    * /actuator/operations - Provides information about ongoing operations.
    * /actuator/tracing - Displays tracing information for requests.
    

Some key features of Spring Boot Actuator include:
1. Health Checks:
    * The /actuator/health endpoint provides information about the application's health status.
    * It can be customized to include checks for databases, messaging systems, and other components.
2. Metrics:
    * The /actuator/metrics endpoint exposes various metrics about the application, such as memory usage, HTTP request statistics, and more.
    * You can also create custom metrics to monitor specific aspects of your application.
3. Environment Information:
    * The /actuator/env endpoint provides details about the application's environment, including configuration properties and system properties.
4. Thread Dump:
    * The /actuator/threaddump endpoint provides a thread dump of the application, which can be useful for diagnosing performance issues.
5. Loggers:
    * The /actuator/loggers endpoint allows you to view and modify the logging levels of your application at runtime.
6. Auditing:
    * The /actuator/auditevents endpoint provides access to audit events, which can be useful for tracking security-related events.
7. Custom Endpoints:
    * You can create your own custom Actuator endpoints to expose additional information or functionality specific to your application.

These features make Spring Boot Actuator an essential tool for monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications in production environments.

Configuration:
    You can configure Actuator endpoints in the application.properties or application.yml file. 
    For example, to enable all Actuator endpoints, you can add the following property:

    ```properties
    management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
    ```

    To restrict access to specific endpoints, you can specify them like this:

    ```properties
    management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
    ```

Security:
    It is important to secure Actuator endpoints in production environments.
    You can use Spring Security to restrict access to sensitive endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can access them.
    For example, you can configure security settings in your application to require authentication for certain Actuator endpoints.
    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class ActuatorSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/actuator/health").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .and()
                .httpBasic();
        }
    }
    ```
