Variables / Fields / Properties / Attributes
------------------------------
In Java, variables (also known as fields, properties, or attributes) are used to store data. They can be classified based on their scope, lifetime, and access level.

Methods / Procedures / Routines / Behaviors / Operations / Actions / Paragraphs / Functions
------------------------------
Methods (also known as procedures, routines, behaviors, operations, actions, paragraphs, or functions) are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. 
They can take parameters, return values, and can be called/invoked from other parts of the program.

Attributes Vs Parameters
------------------------------
Attributes (also known as fields, properties, or variables) are data members of a class that are passed to methods or used within the class.
Parameters (also known as arguments) are Values that are passed to methods to provide input data for processing.

Classes / Blueprints / Templates / Data Types
------------------------------
Classes (also known as blueprints, templates, or data types) define the structure and behavior of objects. They encapsulate data and methods that operate on that data.

Objects / Instances / Entities / Items
------------------------------
Objects (also known as instances, entities, or items) are concrete realizations of classes. 
They hold specific values for the fields defined in the class and can invoke the methods defined in the class.

Packages / Namespaces / Modules / Libraries
------------------------------
Packages (also known as namespaces, modules, or libraries) are used to organize classes and interfaces into a hierarchical structure.
They help avoid naming conflicts and control access to classes and interfaces.

Generics / Type Parameters / Templates
------------------------------
Generics (also known as type parameters or templates) allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a specified type.
They provide type safety and eliminate the need for casting.

Interfaces / Contracts / Protocols
------------------------------
Interfaces (also known as contracts or protocols) define a set of methods that a class must implement.
They provide a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. 

Annotations / Metadata / Decorators
------------------------------
Annotations (also known as metadata or decorators) provide information about the program but are not part of the program itself.
They can be used for various purposes, such as configuration, documentation, and code analysis.

Enums / Enumerated Types / Constants
------------------------------
Enums (also known as enumerated types or constants) are special data types that define a set of named constant values.
They are used to represent a fixed set of related values in a type-safe manner.

Exceptions / Error Handling / Fault Management
------------------------------
Exceptions (also known as error handling or fault management) are used to handle errors and other exceptional conditions in a program.
They provide a way to separate error-handling code from regular code and allow for graceful recovery from errors.

Annotations / Metadata / Decorators
------------------------------
Annotations (also known as metadata or decorators) provide information about the program but are not part of the program itself.
They can be used for various purposes, such as configuration, documentation, and code analysis.
