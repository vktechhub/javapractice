Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or more operands. 
They are used to manipulate data and variables in various ways. 
Here are some common types of operators in Java:
1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus)
2. Relational Operators:
   - `==` (Equal to)
    - `!=` (Not equal to)
    - `>` (Greater than)
    - `<` (Less than)
    - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
    - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
3. Logical Operators:
    - `&&` (Logical AND)
    - `||` (Logical OR)
    - `!` (Logical NOT)
4. Assignment Operators:
    - `=` (Assignment)
    - `+=` (Add and assign)         Example: int a = 5; a += 3; // Now a is 8
    - `-=` (Subtract and assign)    Example: int b = 10; b -= 4; // Now b is 6    
    - `*=` (Multiply and assign)    Example: int c = 7; c *= 2; // Now c is 14
    - `/=` (Divide and assign)      Example: int d = 20; d /= 5; // Now d is 4
    - `%=` (Modulus and assign)     Example: int e = 10; e %= 3; // Now e is 1
5. Unary Operators:
    - `++` (Increment)
    - `--` (Decrement)
    - `+` (Unary plus)
    - `-` (Unary minus)
6. Ternary Operator:
    - `? :` (Conditional operator)
7. Bitwise Operators:
    - `&` (Bitwise AND)
    - `|` (Bitwise OR)
    - `^` (Bitwise XOR)
    - `~` (Bitwise NOT)
    - `<<` (Left shift)
    - `>>` (Right shift)
    - `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)
These operators can be combined in expressions to perform complex calculations and logic operations in Java programs.
