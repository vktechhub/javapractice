@Table: This annotation is used to specify the name of the database table to which the entity is mapped.
@Id: This annotation is used to specify the primary key of an entity.
@GeneratedValue: This annotation is used to specify the generation strategy for the primary key values.
@Column: This annotation is used to specify the details of the column to which a field or property is mapped.
@OneToOne: This annotation is used to specify a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
@OneToMany: This annotation is used to specify a one-to-many relationship between two entities.
@ManyToOne: This annotation is used to specify a many-to-one relationship between two entities.
@ManyToMany: This annotation is used to specify a many-to-many relationship between two entities.
@JoinColumn: This annotation is used to specify the foreign key column for a relationship.
@JoinTable: This annotation is used to specify the join table for a many-to-many relationship.
@Embeddable: This annotation is used to specify that a class is embeddable and can be embedded in an entity.
@Embedded: This annotation is used to specify that a field or property is an embedded object.   
@Transient: This annotation is used to specify that a field or property is not persistent and should not be mapped to a database column.
@Inheritance: This annotation is used to specify the inheritance strategy for entity classes.
@DiscriminatorColumn: This annotation is used to specify the discriminator column for single table inheritance.
@DiscriminatorValue: This annotation is used to specify the discriminator value for a subclass in single table inheritance.
@Version: This annotation is used to specify the version field for optimistic locking.
@Lob: This annotation is used to specify that a field or property should be treated as a large object (LOB) in the database.
@NamedQuery: This annotation is used to define a static named query at the entity level.    
@NamedQueries: This annotation is used to define multiple static named queries at the entity level.
@SqlResultSetMapping: This annotation is used to define the mapping of the result set of a native SQL query to entities or scalar values.
@Converter: This annotation is used to define a custom converter for mapping between the database and the entity attribute.
@Convert: This annotation is used to specify the use of a custom converter for a specific entity attribute.
@AttributeOverride: This annotation is used to override the mapping of an embedded attribute.
@AttributeOverrides: This annotation is used to override the mappings of multiple embedded attributes.
@Access: This annotation is used to specify the access type (field or property) for an entity or a specific attribute.
@Cacheable: This annotation is used to specify whether the entity should be cached by the second-level cache.
@OrderBy: This annotation is used to specify the ordering of a collection of entities.
@OrderColumn: This annotation is used to specify a column that maintains the order of a list of entities.
@ElementCollection: This annotation is used to specify a collection of basic or embeddable types.
@CollectionTable: This annotation is used to specify the table that stores the collection of embeddable types or basic types.
@MapKey: This annotation is used to specify the map key for a map collection.
@MapKeyColumn: This annotation is used to specify the column that stores the map key for a map collection.
@MapKeyJoinColumn: This annotation is used to specify the join column that stores the map key for a map collection of entities.
@OrderColumn: This annotation is used to specify a column that maintains the order of a list of entities.
@Fetch: This annotation is used to specify the fetch strategy (eager or lazy) for a relationship or collection.
@BatchSize: This annotation is used to specify the batch size for fetching collections or entities.
@FetchProfile: This annotation is used to define a fetch profile for optimizing entity loading.
@NamedEntityGraph: This annotation is used to define a named entity graph for specifying fetch plans
