Marker Interface in Java
    A Marker Interface in Java is a special type of interface that does not contain any method declarations or fields. 
    It is used to "mark" or "tag" a class to indicate that it possesses certain properties or behaviors. 
    It is used to mark a class so that the Java runtime or compiler can identify some special behavior or capability of that class.
    Marker interfaces are primarily used for type identification and to provide metadata about a class at runtime.

Why Marker Interfaces Are Used?
    Marker interfaces give information to the JVM or compiler about:
        How to treat the object
        What operation is allowed or disallowed
        What special behavior should be applied
    They function like a flag for the runtime environment.

Common Marker Interfaces in Java:
1. Serializable:
    The Serializable interface is used to indicate that a class can be serialized, which means its objects can be converted into a byte stream for storage or transmission. 
    Classes that implement this interface can be easily saved to files or sent over a network.
2. Cloneable:
    The Cloneable interface is used to indicate that a class supports cloning, which allows for the creation of duplicate objects. 
    Classes that implement this interface can use the Object.clone() method to create copies of their instances.
    If a class does not implement Cloneable, calling clone() on its object throws CloneNotSupportedException.
3. Remote:
    The Remote interface is used in Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) to indicate that a class can be accessed remotely. 
    Classes that implement this interface can have their methods invoked from a different Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Usage of Marker Interfaces:
    To use a marker interface, a class simply needs to implement the interface without providing any method implementations.
