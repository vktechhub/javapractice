Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It typically involves a base case that stops the recursion and a recursive case that breaks the problem into smaller subproblems.

    Base case / Halting condition: The condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow.
    Recursive case: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments to work towards the base case.

    Use cases:-
        * Factorial calculation
        * Fibonacci sequence
        * Tree traversal
        * Backtracking algorithms
        * Divide and conquer algorithms


Here is an example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:
        int result = factorial(number);

    public static int factorial(int n) {
        // Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case: n! = n * (n - 1)!
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
