Java Command Line Commands:
    * java: The java command is used to launch Java applications. It starts the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and runs the specified Java class.
        Syntax: 
            java [options] class [args...]
        Example:
            java MyApp arg1 arg2

            //jar 
            java -jar MyApp.jar arg1 arg2

            Options for java command:
            -cp or -classpath: Specifies the classpath for locating user-defined classes and packages.
            -Xmx: Sets the maximum heap size for the JVM.
            -Xms: Sets the initial heap size for the JVM.

    * javac: The javac command is used to compile Java source files into bytecode (.class files). It takes one or more Java source files as input and produces corresponding class files.
        Syntax:
            javac [options] sourcefiles
        Example:
            javac MyApp.java

    * jar: The jar command is used to create, view, and manipulate Java Archive (JAR) files. JAR files are used to package multiple class files and resources into a single file for distribution.
        Syntax:
            jar [options] [manifest] [jarfile] [inputfiles...]
        Example:
            jar cf MyApp.jar MyApp.class

            Options for jar command:
            c - create a new archive
            f - specify the archive file name
            t - list the contents of an archive
            cf - create a new archive with the specified file name
            xf - extract the contents of an archive

    * javadoc: The javadoc command is used to generate HTML documentation from Java source code comments. It extracts special comments (doc comments) and creates a set of web pages that describe the classes, methods, and fields in the code.
        Syntax:
            javadoc [options] sourcefiles
        Example:
            javadoc MyApp.java

    * javap: The javap command is a disassembler that provides information about the fields and methods of a class. It can be used to inspect the bytecode of compiled Java classes.
        Syntax:
            javap [options] 
            
            //jar 
            javap -c MyApp.jar
        Example:
            javap MyApp

    * jdb: The jdb command is a simple command-line debugger for Java programs. It allows developers to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and control the execution of Java applications.
        Syntax:
            jdb [options] class [args...]
        Example:
            jdb MyApp arg1 arg2

    * jlink: The jlink command is used to create a custom runtime image containing the application and its dependencies. It allows developers to package only the necessary modules required for their application, reducing the size of the runtime.
        Syntax:
            jlink [options] --module-path <path> --add-modules <modules> --output <output-dir>
        Example:
            jlink --module-path mods --add-modules my.module --output my-runtime

    * jshell: The jshell command launches the Java Shell, an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool for evaluating Java code snippets. It allows developers to quickly test and experiment with Java code without the need for a full class or method structure.
        Syntax:
            jshell [options]
        Example:
            jshell

    * jstat: The jstat command is used to monitor various performance statistics of a running Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It provides information about memory usage, garbage collection, class loading, and other JVM metrics.
        Syntax:
            jstat [options] <vmid> [interval] [count]
        Example:
            jstat -gc 12345 1000 10

    * jmap: The jmap command is used to print memory-related statistics and perform heap dumps of a running Java process. It provides insights into the memory usage of the JVM and can help diagnose memory leaks and other issues.
        Syntax:
            jmap [options] <vmid>
        Example:
            jmap -heap 12345

    * jconsole: The jconsole command launches the Java Monitoring and Management Console, a graphical tool for monitoring and managing Java applications. It provides real-time information about memory usage, thread activity, and other performance metrics.
        Syntax:
            jconsole [options] [vmid]
        Example:
            jconsole 12345

    * jcmd: The jcmd command is a versatile tool that allows developers to send diagnostic commands to a running Java process. It can be used for various tasks, such as requesting thread dumps, heap dumps, and garbage collection statistics.
        Syntax:
            jcmd <vmid> <command> [args...] 
        Example:
            jcmd 12345 GC.run
