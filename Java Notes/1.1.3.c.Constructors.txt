What is Constructor
    A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created. 
    It is used to initialize the object's properties and allocate memory for the object. 
    A constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type, not even void.
    It can take parameters to initialize the object's properties with specific values.



Types of Constructor
1. Default Constructor - A constructor that takes no parameters. 
   If no constructor is defined in a class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor that initializes the object with default values.

2. Parameterized Constructor - A constructor that takes parameters to initialize the object's properties with specific values.

3. Copy Constructor - A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. 
   Java does not provide a built-in copy constructor, but you can create one by defining a constructor that takes an object of the same class as a parameter.

4. Static Constructor - Java does not support static constructors. 
   However, static blocks can be used to initialize static variables.


Features of Constructor
1. No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
2. Implicit Call: Constructors are called implicitly when an object is created using the new keyword.
3. Constructor Overloading: A class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists, allowing for different ways to create objects.
4. Constructor Chaining: A constructor can call another constructor in the same class or in the superclass using the this() or super() keywords.
5. this() and super(): 
    The this() keyword is used to call another constructor in the same class, while the super() keyword is used to call a constructor in the superclass. 
    These keywords must be the first statement in the constructor. 


6. Default Constructor during inheritance
    When a subclass is created, it inherits the properties and methods of its superclass. 
    If the superclass has a default constructor, it is called automatically when the subclass is instantiated. 
    If the superclass does not have a default constructor, the subclass must explicitly call a superclass constructor using the super() keyword.
