Default Methods in Java
Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to allow developers to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementations of those interfaces.
A default method is a method defined in an interface with the `default` keyword and includes a method body.
This allows interfaces to evolve over time by adding new methods while maintaining backward compatibility with existing classes that implement the interface.

Key Points about Default Methods:
- Default methods are defined using the `default` keyword in the interface.
- They provide a default implementation that can be used by classes that implement the interface. 
Which can be overridden if needed by the implementing class that implement the interface to provide a specific implementation.
- Default methods can be called on instances of classes that implement the interface.

Example of Default Method in an Interface:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    // Default method
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}
class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // Optionally override the default method
    @Override
    public void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Overridden default method.");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.defaultMethod(); // Output: Overridden default method.

        MyInterface myInterface = new MyInterface() {}; // Anonymous class
        myInterface.defaultMethod(); // Output: This is a default method.
    }
}

When to Use Default Methods?
- Use default methods when you want to add new functionality to an interface without breaking existing implementations.
- They are useful for providing common behavior that can be shared across multiple classes implementing the interface.
- Default methods can help reduce code duplication by allowing shared implementations in the interface itself.
Conflict Resolution with Default Methods
If a class implements multiple interfaces that contain default methods with the same signature, the class must override the conflicting method to resolve the ambiguity.

Can default methods be final?
No, default methods cannot be declared as final. 
Since default methods are meant to provide a default implementation that can be overridden by implementing classes, declaring them as final would contradict their purpose.

Can default methods be static?
No, default methods cannot be static. Default methods are instance methods that provide a default implementation for classes that implement the interface. 
Static methods in interfaces are defined using the `static` keyword and belong to the interface itself, not to instances of the implementing classes.
