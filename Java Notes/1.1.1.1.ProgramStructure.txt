Java Program Structure
A Java program is made up of one or more classes. Each class is defined in its own file with a .java extension. The basic structure of a Java program includes the following components:
1. Package Declaration (optional):
If the class is part of a package, the package declaration must be the first line in the file.
Example 
    package com.example.myapp;
2. Import Statements (optional):
Import statements are used to bring other classes or entire packages into the current file.
Example 
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.ArrayList;
3. Class Declaration
Every Java program must have at least one class. The class declaration includes the class name and its body enclosed in curly braces.
Example 
    public class MyClass {
        // class body
    }
4. Main Method
The main method is the entry point of any Java application. It must be defined as follows:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // code to be executed
    }
5. Fields and Methods
Inside the class body, you can define fields (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of the class.
Example 
    public class MyClass {
        // Field or Variable or Attribute or Property or Member 
        private int myField;

        // Method
        public void myMethod() {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }

Putting It All Together
Here is a complete example of a simple Java program:
    package com.example.myapp;

    import java.util.ArrayList;

    public class MyClass {
        private int myField;

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyClass obj = new MyClass();
            obj.myMethod();
        }

        public void myMethod() {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }

This program defines a class named MyClass within the package com.example.myapp, imports the ArrayList class, and contains a main method that creates an instance of MyClass and calls the myMethod to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
