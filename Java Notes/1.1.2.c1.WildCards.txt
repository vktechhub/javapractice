Wildcards in Generics
    In Java Generics, wildcards are used when you don’t know the exact type. 
    They are represented by the question mark symbol (?).
    Wildcards are mainly used in method parameters to increase the reuse and flexibility of the code by allowing methods to accept a wider range of types with type safety.

Types of Wildcards:

        Unbounded Wildcard
            This wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?)
            These are useful in the following cases -
                When writing a method that can be employed using functionality provided in Object class.
                When the code is using methods in the generic class that doesn't depend on the type parameter.
            Syntax: 
                Collectiontype <?>
                List<?> list
                    Readable but NOT addable(except null) because type is unknown.
            
        Upper Bounded Wildcard
            These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a variable. 
            For example, say you want to write a method that works on List < Integer >, List < Double > and List < Number >, you can do this using an upper bounded wildcard. 
            To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character ('?'), followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound. 
                
            List<? extends Number>
                Readable but NOT addable (except null).

        Lower Bounded Wildcard
            It is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), followed by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>. 

            Syntax: 
                Collectiontype <? super A>
                List<? super Integer>

            Writable.
                    We can add Integer or its subclasses.
                    Readable but only as Object type.

📌 Summary
Type	            Read	Write
List<?>	            ✔	    ✖
List<? extends T>	✔	    ✖
List<? super T>	    ✔	    ✔(T or child)
