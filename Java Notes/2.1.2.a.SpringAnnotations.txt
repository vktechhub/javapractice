Spring Framework provides various annotations to facilitate Dependency Injection and manage beans in the application context. 
Here are some commonly used Spring Annotations:
1. @Component
    * It is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
    * It indicates that an annotated class is a "component". 
        Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning.

2. @Service
    * It is a specialization of the @Component annotation.
    * It indicates that an annotated class is a "Service", originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as "an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, with no encapsulated state."
    * It is used to mark the service layer classes.

3. @Repository
    * It is also a specialization of the @Component annotation.
    * It indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", which is an abstraction of data access and storage.
    * It is used to mark the Data Access Object (DAO) classes.

4. @Controller
    * It is a specialization of the @Component annotation.
    * It indicates that an annotated class is a "Controller", typically used in Spring MVC to handle web requests.
    * It is used to mark the presentation layer classes.

5. @Autowired
    * If many Constructors were there, you can apply @Autowired on only one Construtor.
    * @Autowired becomes optional in classes with Single Constructor from Spring version > 4.3

    * Use @Component + @Autowired Constructor (Recommended modern way) 

6. @Qualifier
    * It is used along with @Autowired to resolve the ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present in the Spring context.
    * It allows you to specify which bean should be injected.

7. @Value
    * It is used to inject values into fields in Spring-managed beans.
    * It can be used to inject simple values, such as strings or numbers, as well as values from properties files.

8. @Configuration
    * It indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.

9. @Bean
    * It indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
    * It is typically used in @Configuration classes to define beans.

10. @Scope
    * It is used to specify the scope of a bean.
    * Common scopes include "singleton" (default) and "prototype".

11. @PostConstruct
    * It is used to specify a method that should be executed after the bean's properties have been set.
    * It is typically used for initialization logic.

12. @PreDestroy
    * It is used to specify a method that should be executed before the bean is destroyed.
    * It is typically used for cleanup logic.
    
13. @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
    * It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
    * It indicates that the class is a RESTful web service controller, and the return values of its methods should be serialized directly to the HTTP response body.
