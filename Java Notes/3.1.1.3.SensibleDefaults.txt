SpringBoot Sensible Defaults:
    SpringBoot provides sensible defaults to streamline the development process and reduce the need for extensive configuration. 
    These defaults are designed to work well for most applications, allowing developers to get started quickly without having to make many decisions upfront.

Some examples of sensible defaults in Spring Boot include:
1. Default Port:
    * Spring Boot applications run on port 8080 by default. 
    * This can be easily changed in the application.properties or application.yml file if needed.   

2. Embedded Server:
    * Spring Boot includes an embedded server (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) by default, allowing you to run your application as a standalone Java application without the need for an external server.
    * This simplifies deployment and development.
3. Default Logging Configuration:
    * Spring Boot comes with a default logging configuration that uses Logback as the logging framework.    
    * It provides sensible logging levels and formats out of the box, which can be customized as needed.
4. Auto-configuration:
    * Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project.
    * It eliminates the need for extensive XML configuration or Java-based configuration.
5. Default Error Handling:
    * Spring Boot provides a default error handling mechanism that returns a standard error response in case of exceptions.
    * This can be customized by creating your own error handling logic if needed.
6. Static Resource Handling:
    * Spring Boot automatically serves static resources (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) from predefined locations (e.g., /static, /public, /resources, /META-INF/resources) in the classpath.
    * This allows you to easily include static content in your application without additional configuration.
7. Default View Resolvers:
    * Spring Boot provides default view resolvers for popular templating engines like Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and JSP.
    * This allows you to quickly set up views in your application without extensive configuration.

8. Actuator Endpoints:
    * Spring Boot Actuator comes with a set of pre-configured endpoints that provide insights into the application's health, metrics, and other operational information.
    * These endpoints are enabled by default and can be customized or extended as needed.

9. Database Configuration:
    * Spring Boot provides sensible defaults for database configuration, including automatic configuration of DataSource, JPA, and Hibernate based on the dependencies present in the project.
    * It also includes default settings for connection pooling and transaction management.

10. Security Defaults:
    * Spring Boot Security provides default security configurations, such as requiring authentication for all endpoints and using in-memory user details for authentication.
    * These defaults can be easily customized to fit the specific security requirements of your application.

These sensible defaults in Spring Boot help reduce boilerplate code and configuration, allowing developers to focus on building their applications quickly and efficiently.

These sensible defaults help developers get started quickly with Spring Boot applications while still allowing for customization and flexibility as needed.
