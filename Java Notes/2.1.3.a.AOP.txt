AOP - Aspect Oriented Programming
For Non Functional Requirement(service logic) - Not for Business logic

how to make aspect class

@Aspect     // indicates this is an aspect
@Component // to make it spring managed
class {
    // use aspect-advice annotations like @Before, @After, etc... and giving pointcut definition
}

@EnableAspectJAutoProxy         // to enable AOP support in Spring configuration class
@Configuration                  // to make it spring managed
class Main{
}

Understanding AOP Concepts
1. Aspect: An Aspect is a modular unit of cross-cutting concerns. For example, a logging aspect can be applied across various methods in different classes.

2. Join Point: A specific point in the execution of a program, such as method execution or exception handling, where an aspect can be applied.

3. Advice: This is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. There are five types of advice:
    Before: Executed before the method call.
    After: Executed after the method call, regardless of its outcome.
    AfterReturning: Executed after the method returns a result, but not if an exception occurs.
    Around: Surrounds the method execution, allowing you to control the method execution and its result.
    AfterThrowing: Executed if the method throws an exception.

4. Pointcut: A Pointcut is a predicate that defines where advice should be applied. It matches join points using expressions.

5. Weaving: This is the process of linking aspects with the target object. Spring AOP only supports runtime weaving using proxy-based mechanisms (JDK dynamic proxies for interfaces and CGLIB for concrete classes). It does not modify bytecode like AspectJ.
