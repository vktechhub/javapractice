Comparator and Comparable in Java:-

Comparable interface and compareTo() method: 
    This is used for defining the natural ordering of objects within a class. 
    A class implements the Comparable interface and overrides the compareTo(T o) method. 
    This method returns:
        A negative integer if the current object is less than the specified object.
        Zero if the current object is equal to the specified object.
        A positive integer if the current object is greater than the specified object.

Comparator interface and compare() method: 
    This is used for defining custom ordering of objects, allowing for multiple sorting criteria. 
    A Comparator is typically implemented in a separate class or as a lambda expression. 
    The compare(T o1, T o2) method takes two objects and returns 
        a negative integer if the first object is less than the second,
        zero if the first object is equal to the second,
        a positive integer if the first object is greater than the second.
