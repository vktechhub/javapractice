General Syntax for Variable Declaration
        <access_modifier> <static_modifier> <final_modifier> <data_type> <variable_name> = <value>;

        Example:- 
            public static final int max_Score = 100;

        access_modifier	
            Optional. Can be public, private, protected, or default (package-private).
            Private - only within the same class
            Default (No modifier) - within the same package only
            Protected - same package and subclasses in any package
            Public - Accessible from anywhere
            Best Practices:
                    Use private for fields and internal methods.
                    Use public for APIs and utility classes/methods.
                    Use protected in inheritance hierarchies.
                    Avoid default unless package-level access is intended.
        Static - Optional. Means the variable belongs to the class, not instances.
        Final - Optional. Makes the variable a constant (value cannot change).
                final double PI = 3.14159;

        dataType - Mandatory. Any valid Java type (primitive or reference).
                    Primitive Types:
                            byte, short, int, long
                            float, double
                            char
                            boolean
                    Reference Types:
                            Class names (String, Integer, List, etc.)
        variableName - Mandatory. Must follow Java naming rules.
                    Must begin with a letter, $, or _
                    Cannot be a keyword
                    Follow camelCase by convention for variables
        = value	 - Optional. Assigns an initial value (initialization).

Multiple Variable Declarations
        int x = 5, y = 10, z = 15; // Different values
        int x = y = z = 10;        // Same value

More examples:-
    Primitive
        int age = 40;
        static final double price_Of_Product = 10.34;
        final char genderOfStudent = 'M';
        private boolean isPassed = true;
        long population = 1400000000L;
        float temperature = 36.6f;
        byte smallNumber = 10;
        short distance = 1500;
    Reference
        String name = "Vignesh";
        Integer number = 100;
        Double average = 85.5;
        Character symbol = '@';
    Array
        int[] marks = {90, 85, 78};
        String[] colors = {"Red", "Green", "Blue"};
        double[] prices = new double[3];

    Variables with Different Access Modifiers
        public class Student {
            public String name = "Kanna";   // accessible from anywhere
            protected int rollNumber = 12;  // same package + subclasses
            String course = "BCA";          // default (package-level)
            private double marks = 92.5;    // only inside this class
        }
        💡 Access modifiers control who can access the variable.
    

Types of Variables
        Local Variables - Declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks. Scope is limited to that block.
        Instance Variables - Declared in a class but outside any method. Each object has its own copy.
        Static Variables - Declared with the static keyword. Shared among all instances of the class.

Constants
        Use the final keyword to declare constants. When final is used, the variable's value cannot be changed once assigned.
        Example:
            final double PI = 3.14159;
            static final int MAX_SCORE = 100;

        Best Practices for Constants:
            Use uppercase letters with underscores for constant names (e.g., MAX_SCORE).
            Declare constants as static final if they are class-level constants.
            Group related constants in interfaces or classes for better organization.
