Asynchronous Programming in Spring Boot:-
    Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run in the background without blocking the main thread. In Spring Boot, you can achieve asynchronous behavior using the `@Async` annotation.

* Enable Asynchronous Support:
   To enable asynchronous support in your Spring Boot application, you need to add the `@EnableAsync` annotation to one of your configuration classes.

        ```java 
        @SpringBootApplication
        @EnableAsync
        public class AsynchronousApplication {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                SpringApplication.run(AsynchronousApplication.class, args);
            }

            @Bean
            public Executor taskExecutor() {
                ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
                executor.setCorePoolSize(2);
                executor.setMaxPoolSize(5);
                executor.setQueueCapacity(500);
                executor.setThreadNamePrefix("Async-");
                executor.initialize();
                return executor;
            }
        }
        ```

* ThreadpoolTaskExecutor:- 
   You can customize the thread pool used for asynchronous tasks by defining a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` bean.

        * setcorePoolSize(int corePoolSize): Sets the core number of threads.
        * setMaxPoolSize(int maxPoolSize): Sets the maximum allowed number of threads.
        * setQueueCapacity(int queueCapacity): Sets the capacity of the queue to hold tasks before they are executed.
        * setThreadNamePrefix(String threadNamePrefix): Sets the prefix for the names of newly created threads.
        * initialize(): Initializes the executor.
        * public Executor taskExecutor(): This method returns the configured ThreadPoolTaskExecutor as an Executor bean.
* Using @Async Annotation:
   You can annotate methods with `@Async` to indicate that they should run asynchronously.

        ```java
        @Service
        public class AsyncService {

            @Async
            public CompletableFuture<String> performAsyncTask() {
                // Simulate a long-running task
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(5000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Task Completed");
            }
        }
        ```
