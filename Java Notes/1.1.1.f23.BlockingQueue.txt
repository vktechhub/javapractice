A BlockingQueue is part of the java.util.concurrent package, not java.util.

It extends the Queue interface and adds thread-safe, blocking operations for producer–consumer scenarios.

In other words:
    It’s a Queue, but with built-in synchronization and waiting behavior.
    It blocks threads automatically when the queue is full (on insertion) or empty (on removal).

That’s why it’s categorized under the Concurrent Collections group.


Common BlockingQueue Implementations
Class	                    Description
ArrayBlockingQueue	        Fixed-size array-based blocking queue
LinkedBlockingQueue	        Linked-node based, optionally bounded
PriorityBlockingQueue	    Ordered elements, unbounded
DelayQueue	                Elements become available after a delay
SynchronousQueue	        No internal storage — each put waits for a take
LinkedTransferQueue	        Optimized for high concurrency
