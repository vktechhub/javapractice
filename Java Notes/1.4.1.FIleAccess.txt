I/O Streams in Java
In Java, I/O streams are the fundamental mechanism for handling input and output operations. They provide a uniform way to read data from various sources (files, network, memory) and write data to different destinations.

Java I/O streams are categorized into two main types based on the type of data they handle:
1. Byte Streams: These streams handle raw binary data and are used for reading and writing binary files such as images, audio files, and executable files. 
        The main abstract classes for byte streams are 
                InputStream and 
                OutputStream, 
        along with their implementations like 
                FileInputStream: reads raw bytes from a file.
                FileOutputStream: writes raw bytes to a file.
                BufferedInputStream / BufferedOutputStream: use buffering for faster performance.
                ByteArrayInputStream: reads data from a byte array as if it were an input stream.
                ByteArrayOutputStream: writes data into a byte array, which grows automatically.

2. Character Streams: These streams handle character data and are used for reading and writing text files. They automatically handle character encoding and decoding. 
        The main abstract classes for character streams are 
                Reader and 
                Writer, 
        along with their implementations like 
                FileReader: reads characters from a file.
                FileWriter: writes characters to a file.
                BufferedReader: reads text efficiently using buffering; also provides readLine() for reading lines.
                BufferedWriter: writes text efficiently using buffering.
                StringReader: reads characters from a string.
                StringWriter: writes characters into a string buffer.


Java File access:-
1. Create a new file using createNewFile() method of File class.
        try {
            File Obj = new File("myfile.txt");
            
          	// Creating File
          	if (Obj.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created: " + Obj.getName());
            }
            else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        }
      
      	// Exception Thrown
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

2. Write data to a file using FileWriter class.
        try {
            FileWriter Writer = new FileWriter("myfile.txt");
            Writer.write("Hello, this is a sample text.");
            Writer.close();
            System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
        } 
        catch (FileNotFoundException e) // File not found exception
        {
            System.out.println("File not found.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }      
      	// Exception Thrown
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("An unexpected error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

3. Read data from a file using FileReader and BufferedReader classes.
        try {
            FileReader Reader = new FileReader("myfile.txt");
            BufferedReader BufferedReader = new BufferedReader(Reader);
            String line;
            while ((line = BufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            BufferedReader.close();
        } 
        catch (FileNotFoundException e) // File not found exception
        {
            System.out.println("File not found.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }    
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("An unexpected error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

2. read using Scanner class.
        try {
            File file = new File("myfile.txt");
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                String line = scanner.nextLine();
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            scanner.close();
        } 
        catch (FileNotFoundException e) // File not found exception
        {
            System.out.println("File not found.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }    
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("An unexpected error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

4. Delete a file using delete() method of File class.
        try {
            File Obj = new File("myfile.txt");
            if (Obj.delete()) {
                System.out.println("Deleted the file: " + Obj.getName());
            } 
            else {
                System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
            }
        } 
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
