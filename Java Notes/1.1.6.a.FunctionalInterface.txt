Functional Interface
* A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. This concept is a key feature of Java 8 and later versions, enabling the use of lambda expressions and method references.

Key Characteristics:
* Single Abstract Method: A functional interface must have exactly one abstract method. This method defines the contract that the implementing class must fulfill.
* Default and Static Methods: A functional interface can have multiple default and static methods. These methods do not count as abstract methods.
* @FunctionalInterface Annotation: 
    While not mandatory, it is a good practice to use the @FunctionalInterface annotation. 
    This annotation helps to indicate that the interface is intended to be a functional interface and allows the compiler to generate an error if the interface does not meet the criteria.

Example:
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void execute(); // Single abstract method

    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}

Usage with Lambda Expressions:
MyFunctionalInterface funcInterface = () -> System.out.println("Executing the functional interface method.");
funcInterface.execute(); // Output: Executing the functional interface method.

Common Functional Interfaces in Java:
Java provides several built-in functional interfaces in the java.util.function package.(Covered in detail in later sections))

Benefits:
Conciseness: Functional interfaces allow for more concise and readable code using lambda expressions.
Flexibility: They enable functional programming paradigms in Java, allowing for higher-order functions and more abstract code.
Interoperability: Functional interfaces facilitate the use of APIs that leverage functional programming concepts.
In summary, functional interfaces are a fundamental part of Java's support for functional programming, enabling developers to write cleaner and more expressive code.
