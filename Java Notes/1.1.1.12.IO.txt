Input and Output (I/O) in Java:-
Java provides a robust set of classes and methods for handling input and output operations. 
The primary packages used for I/O operations are `java.io` and `java.nio`.

1. **Streams**:
   - Java uses streams to handle I/O operations. A stream is a sequence of data that can be read from or written to.
   - There are two types of streams:
     - Byte Streams: Handle binary data (e.g., `InputStream`, `OutputStream`).
     - Character Streams: Handle character data (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`).
2. **File I/O**:
   - Java provides classes to read from and write to files, such as `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `FileReader`, and `FileWriter`.
   - The `Files` class in `java.nio.file` package provides methods for file operations like reading, writing, copying, and deleting files.
3. **Buffered I/O**:
    - Buffered streams improve performance by reducing the number of I/O operations. Examples include `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`.
4. **Data I/O**:
   - For reading and writing primitive data types, Java provides `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream`.
5. **Object I/O**:
   - Java supports serialization, allowing objects to be converted into a byte stream and vice versa using `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`.    
6. **Standard I/O**:
   - Java provides standard input and output streams: `System.in` for input, `System.out` for output, and `System.err` for error output.
7. **NIO (New I/O)**:
   - The `java.nio` package offers a more flexible and efficient way to handle I/O operations using channels and buffers.
   - It supports non-blocking I/O operations, which can improve performance in certain applications.
8. **Exception Handling**:
   - I/O operations can throw exceptions, so it is essential to handle them using try-catch blocks or by declaring them in the method signature.

Scanner Class for Input:-
   The Scanner class is also widely used for reading input from various sources, including user input from the console.
   Scanner is part of the `java.util` package and provides methods to parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions.
   Input Sources:
    - Standard Input (keyboard) - System.in 
    - Files                     - Example: new Scanner(new File("input.txt"))    
    - Strings                   - Example: new Scanner("some string")
    - Other input streams       - Example: new Scanner(InputStream)
   Functions of Scanner Class:
    - `nextInt()`: Reads the next integer from the input.
    - `nextLine()`: Reads the next line of text from the input.
    - `nextDouble()`: Reads the next double value from the input.
    - `next()`: Reads the next token from the input.
    - `hasNext()`: Checks if there is another token in the input.
    - `close()`: Closes the scanner and releases any associated resources.

Example of using Scanner for input:
    ```java
    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class ScannerExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            
            System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
            int intValue = scanner.nextInt();
            
            System.out.print("Enter a double: ");
            double doubleValue = scanner.nextDouble();
            
            scanner.nextLine(); // Consume the newline character
            
            System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
            String stringValue = scanner.nextLine();
            
            System.out.println("You entered: " + intValue + ", " + doubleValue + ", " + stringValue);
            
            scanner.close();
        }
    }

This example demonstrates how to use the Scanner class to read different types of input from the user.
